## Introduction

This little tutorial will walk you through how to convert a shapefile into a geodatabase feature class using ArcGIS. This will be broken into two larger parts:

1. Creating a geodatabase
2. Converting a shapefile into a feature class

By the end, you should be able to work with your layer as a feature class in a geodatabase.

## Creating a geodatabase

When using a geodatabase it's important to keep in mind that the geodatabase itself is just a container for data. While it has special functionality for spatial data, it serves the same purpose as any other file folder on your computer. In fact, if you look at a geodatabase outside of ArcCatalog or ArcMap it will just look like a folder on your computer.

The data that are stored in a geodatabase are called *feature classes*. These are similar to shapefiles. What you'll really be doing through this process is converting a shapefile to a feature class that resides in a geodatabase. But before you can do that conversion, you need a place, a geodatabase, for your feature class to be stored. In short, you need to create a geodatabase:

1. In ArcMap, open up the ArcCatalog pane. You can access this from the toolbar:<br>

2. In the ArcCatalog pane, navigate to a folder where you want to store your geodatabase. In this example, I'll be using `C:\temp`, but you can use whichever folder you'd like.<br>![](http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/gscplanning/shp2gdb/catalog2_zpssjdt66gm.jpg)
3. Right-click on the folder where you want to store your geodatabase, navigate to **New>File Geodatabase**. Left-click **File Geodatabase**<br>![](http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/gscplanning/shp2gdb/catalog3_zpsfuqq3n14.jpg)
4. You've created a new file geodatabase! ArcCatalog names it **New File Geodatabase.gdb** by default, but also gives you the option to rename it. <br>![](http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/gscplanning/shp2gdb/catalog4_zpsoey15fy7.jpg)
5. Give your geodatabase a name appropriate for your project. I'll be naming mine **project.gdb**. (You may need to right-click and navigate to *Rename* to change the geodatabase's name)<br>![](http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/gscplanning/shp2gdb/catalog5_zpswfxj2jrt.jpg)

Congratulations! You've successfully create a new file geodatabase. You'll now be able to add feature classes, including those converted from existing shapefiles, to your geodatabase.

## Converting a shapefile to a feature class

Let's walk through how to convert a shapefile into a feature class for storage in the  geodatabase you just made. There are a few ways to do this though it seems to work most reliably for me from the ArcMap *Table Of Contents*, but I'll also outline how to get the same results from ArcCatalog and using the **Feature Class to Feature Class** tool, respectively.

### via ArcMap *Table of Contents*
*This assumes you have the layer you want to convert loaded into an ArcMap project*

1. Find your layer to convert in the *Table of Contents*. Right-click.<br>![](http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/gscplanning/shp2gdb/arcmap1_zpseajn9oel.jpg)
2. Navigate to **Data>Export Data**. Left-click.<br>![](http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/gscplanning/shp2gdb/arcmap2_zpsb6x6gx3y.jpg)
3. The *Export Data* dialog box should open up. For the sake of the example we'll leave the defaults as they are, but we need to tell Arc to export the shapefile as a feature class and into which geodatabase to place the result of the export. To start this process, left-click on the little folder button under *Output feature class*.<br>![](http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/gscplanning/shp2gdb/arcmap3_zpsa2zfjved.jpg)
4. This will bring up the *Saving Data* dialog box. At the bottom of the dialog box is an option field, **Save as type**. The default will likely be shapefile. You can change that by clicking the option menu (the one currently showing "Shapefile") and selecting **File and Personal Geodatabase feature class**.<br>![](http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/gscplanning/shp2gdb/arcmap4_zpsrtzedwf1.jpg)
5. If the **Look in** field matches the folder You should see a little cannister icon and the name of your geodatabase. If not, you'll need to navigate to the folder where your geodatabase is. Once **Look in** is set to the folder your geodatabase is in, double-click your geodatabase.<br>![](http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/gscplanning/shp2gdb/arcmap5_zpsq5grg16b.jpg)
6. Since you just created this geodatabase, there shouldn't be any feature classes listed in it. Let's change that. Look down at the **Name** field. It defaults to `Export_Output`. I'll be naming the feature class `points`, but name your file something appropriate for your project. Click "Save".<br>![](http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/gscplanning/shp2gdb/arcmap6_zpsgmzu0xiq.jpg)
7. The The **Save as type** dialog box will close. You should see the **Export Data** dialog box. Click "OK".<br>![](http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/gscplanning/shp2gdb/arcmap7_zpslzhjcpch.jpg)
8. A dialog box will appear asking if you want to add your newly converted feature class to you map. Click "Yes" to add your feature class to the map.<br>![](http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/gscplanning/shp2gdb/arcmap8_zpsms74dbn8.jpg)

Your shapefile has successfully been converted to a geodatabase feature class. Way to go!

### via ArcCatalog

(This assumes you're accessing ArcCatalog from within ArcMap. However, the process is pretty much the same in the standalone version of ArcCatalog)

1. In the *Catalog* pane, find the shapefile you'd like to convert into a geodatabase feature class. Right-click.<br>![](http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/gscplanning/shp2gdb/catalog6_zpssjubm7el.jpg)
2. Navigate to **Export>To Geodatabase (single)...**. Left-click.<br>![](http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/gscplanning/shp2gdb/catalog7_zpsxhur8gue.jpg)
3. This opens the **Feature Class to Feature Class** tool. **Input Features** is already filled in with the name of the layer you want to convert.<br>![](http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/gscplanning/shp2gdb/fc1_zpsqu63el7v.jpg)
4. Set **Output Location** by clicking the browse button at the field's end. When you get to the folder that contains your geodatabase, left-click the geodatabase **once** and click the "Add" button.<br>![](http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/gscplanning/shp2gdb/fc2_zpszq5bxhsf.jpg)
5. Set **Output Feature Class** to the name you want for your converted feature class<br>![](http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/gscplanning/shp2gdb/fc3_zpsqgzkbrts.jpg)

The new feature class layer will be added to your map. Way to go!

### via **Feature Class to Feature Class** tool

You can also access the **Feature Class to Feature Class** tool directly from within ArcMap.

1. If you don't have the ArcToolbox pane open, open it from your toolbar<br>![](http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/gscplanning/shp2gdb/fc4_zps2fb6w7xs.jpg)
2. In the ArcToolbox pane, navigate to **Conversion Tools>To Geodatabase>Feature Class to Feature Class**. Double-click.<br>![](http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/gscplanning/shp2gdb/fc5_zpss0qnbcmd.jpg)
3. This opens the **Feature Class to Feature Class** tool. For the **Input Features** field you need to identify the shapefile you want to convert. If your shapefile is in the *Table Of Contents* of your ArcMap project, you can select it by expanding the drop-down menu and left-clicking that layer. Otherwise, click the browse button at the field's end. When you get to the folder that contains your shapefile, left-click the shapefile **once** and click the "Add" button.<br>![](http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/gscplanning/shp2gdb/fc8_zpslspu7lat.jpg)
4. Set **Output Location** by clicking the browse button at the field's end. When you get to the folder that contains your geodatabase, left-click the geodatabase **once** and click the "Add" button.<br>![](http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/gscplanning/shp2gdb/fc2_zpszq5bxhsf.jpg)
5. Set **Output Feature Class** to the name you want for your converted feature class<br>![](http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/gscplanning/shp2gdb/fc3_zpsqgzkbrts.jpg)

The new feature class layer will be added to your map automatically. Congratulations on a successful conversion!
